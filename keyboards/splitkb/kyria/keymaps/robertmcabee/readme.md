This is my keymap.

- Colemak-DH layout
- Space and shift on home thumb postitions.
- Option, Cmd, Shift & Ctrl are all usable with thumbs.
- Standard numpad layout to utilize existing muscle memory
- One-Shot Layers

*"Hyper Esc" shown on keymap is actually KC_CAPS - It works for my setup, don't @ me.*
